CONST PUSH WITHOUT ERROR:-

const fruits = ["apple","mango"];
fruits.push("banana");
console.log(fruits);

Here we can push into a const because we store the array in the heap memory and fruits here
store only the memory of that location. So as we push into it we are not selection new location
or new address to it we are just pushing into the current location only


If we do like fruits = [] something something then we are changing the location and this is not
acceptablable for the const


------------------------------------------------------------------------

For of Loop
for(let fruit of fruits){
    console.log(fruit);
}
This is another way of traversing over array like python or C++
---------------------------------------------------------------------



For in Loop
for(let index in fruits){
    console.log(index , fruits[index]);
}

 when we use "in" here then we are dealing with the index

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Destructuring of array
const myArray = [v1, v2 , v3 , v4];

const[var1 , var2] = myArray;

this way we are giving var1 = v1; and var2 = v2

we can skip one like this const[var1 , , var3] = myArray;
we can store first two in two differet variables and all the rest as new array in this way
const [var1 , var2 , ...myNewArray] = myArray
so myNewArray = [v3,v4];

OBJECT in Js

key is always string so person["name"] = person.name 
if we want to create a new field in the person
const person = {
    name: "Yash",
    age:23,
    hobbies:["cricket","reading"]
}

person.gender ="Male"

then it will create a gender specification in it
you can write name in the object like 
person = {
    name:
    "name"
}

both ways are correct

also if you want to give key name with a space between 2 letters
like


const person={
    "person hobbies":[]
}

then you have to give "" and then use it and when u have to access it 
person.person hobbies is wrong way
you can only use square bracket
person["person hobbies"];

----
mast chz

const key = "email"

person[key]="yashsomani@gmail.com"

then log will show email:yashsomani@gmail.com

when we need to traverse over object in for Loop we need to use square bracket in place of dot(.)


for(let key in person){
    log(person.key); // will give 
    log(person[key]); // this will give you result
}

----------
Computed Properties
const key1 = ob1;
const key2 = ob2;

const obj = {
    [key1]:"hello",
    [key2]:"world"
    //now it will show ob1 : hello , ob2 : world in the console.log
}
